# Library Management System
A mini project using Java Swing where we need to login via username and password to go to the home page.
In the home page, we can add a new student, add a new book, issue a book, return a book and check status of the book issued and returned and finally logout.
Different kinds of validations are also used here. All the data are stored in database and handled using MySql.














# Features Used
